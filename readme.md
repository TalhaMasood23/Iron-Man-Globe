# 🌐 MOMENT WHEN IRON MAN FOUND OUT THE NEW TIME TRAVEL

> A futuristic, frontend-only web experience inspired by the moment Tony Stark cracked time travel. It features a fully interactive 3D globe that can be rotated using real-time hand gestures — built using Three.js and MediaPipe.

## 🎬 Preview

Coming soon! (You can host it with Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🧠 **Three.js** – For rendering the 3D globe
- ✋ **MediaPipe Hands** – For detecting and tracking hand movements via webcam
- 🖐️ **Webcam Input** – Real-time hand control
- ⚡ **Vite** + **React** (or vanilla JS) – Frontend dev and bundling
- 🎨 **Custom UI/UX** – Inspired by Stark Industries lab interfaces

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- Webcam access (MediaPipe requires webcam for gesture control)

### 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ironman-time-travel.git
cd ironman-time-travel


Install dependencies:
npm install

▶️ Run the App
npm run dev

✋ How It Works
Three.js renders a realistic 3D globe.
MediaPipe Hands tracks your hand in real-time using your webcam.
Gestures like open/close hand or horizontal motion rotate the globe.
You become Tony Stark, waving through time and space 🌌.

Let me know:
- If you want gesture documentation (e.g. “open hand = rotate globe”)
- If it’s built with React or plain JavaScript
- If you'd like a deployment guide
- I can help expand or tailor it even more!
